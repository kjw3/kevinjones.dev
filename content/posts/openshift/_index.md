## Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

Welcome to the OpenShift series on this blog. If you're here, you're probably familiar with what Red Hat OpenShift is aboutâ€”Kubernetes, container orchestration, and all that. The official documentation is great for getting started, but there's more to the story. In this series, I'll leverage my background in enterprise computing to give you insights you won't find in the standard guides.

We'll look at real-world applications, explore OpenShift's architecture in a way that actually makes sense, and discuss some of the lesser-known features that can supercharge your operations. So if you're interested in OpenShift beyond the official line, stick around.
